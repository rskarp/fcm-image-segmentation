# FCM for Image Segmentation
The goal of this project, conducted in the Fall 2022 semester of EN.525.770: Intelligent Algorithms at Johns Hopkins University Engineering for Professionals Program, was to identify a published paper on an application of intelligent algorithms and attempt to replicate the results of the paper.

The paper that I selected was ["Central Perturbation-based Interval Type-2 Fuzzy C-Means Clustering for Image Segmentation" (Rong et al, 2022)](https://doi.org/10.1109/ICNLP55136.2022.00025). I replicated the paper results by implementing three different variations of fuzzy c-means clustering algorithms, and applied them to 5 generated graphical datasets and 5 images from the [Berkley Segmentation Dataset](https://www2.eecs.berkeley.edu/Research/Projects/CS/vision/grouping/resources.html). An example for one image can be seen below, and the full results can be seen in the RKarp_Final Presentation.pdf slides.
